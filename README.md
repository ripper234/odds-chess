Odds Chess is a difficulty-adjusted chess where the odds of winning are always 50%

It is chess app where your chances of winning are always 50%.
It automatically adjusts the time allotted to you over repeated games.
The more you win, the less time you get to play.
Material handicap is also possible.

This could be a cool way for friends of different skill levels to "fairly" play one another.

Currently looking for feedback and [alpha testers](http://oddschess.launchrock.com).
